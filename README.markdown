ZZLib
=====

ZZLib is a collection of iOS classes and macros cought by me on the Internet
and integrated with each other. The main idea is to keep the library easy to use and make it very simple.

Features
--------

- ARC support
- Native iOS Base64 and JSON support
- easy tables with remote JSON data
- easy non-table controllers with remote JSON data
- async remote image loading
- table view cell class with remote image
- easy controller creation without NIB files
- you can still use NIB files
- marvelous activity indicator (start indication if activity is long enough)
- very clear logging (`ZZLOG`)
- web-view with navigation and loading indicating
- HTTP requests support: GET, POST, PUT
- number of useful macros and functions: `ZZIsPad`, `ZZRGBA`, `ZZIs5` (to detect iPhone 5), `ZZIs7` (to detect iOS 7)
- simple text utils such as capitalization, etc
- a category to set fonts recursively in subviews

Installation
------------

1. Clone the repository:
	git://github.com/iutinvg/ZZLib.git
2. This will create ZZLib folder, where you can find ZZ.xcodeproj. Open it in Xcode.
3. Drag ZZLib group and drop it in your project.

How to Learn More
-----------------

1. ZZLib contains a demo application which you can compile and start in simulator.
   The files within Demo group of ZZLib project are great examples of library usage.
2. Read the docs: http://sevencrayons.com/ZZLib/
3. Read the sources. They are pretty flat, besides there are some examples of good
   practices used by great developers all over the world (see Thanks section).
