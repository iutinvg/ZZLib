ZZLib
=====

ZZLib is a collection of iPhone classes and macros cought by us on the Internet
and integrated with each other. Our main idea is to keep the library easy to use and make it very simple.

Generated documentation: http://iutinvg.github.com/ZZLib/

Features
--------

- easy tables with remote JSON data
- easy non-table controllers with remote JSON data
- async remote image loading
- table view cell class with remote image
- easy controller creation without NIB files
- you can still use NIB files
- marvelous activity indicator
- very clear logging (`ZZLOG`)
- number of useful macros and functions: `ZZIsPad`, `ZZRGBA`, etc

Installation
============

1. Clone the repository:
	git://github.com/iutinvg/ZZLib.git
2. This will create ZZLib folder, where you can find ZZ.xcodeproj. Open it in Xcode.
3. Drag ZZLib group and drop it in your project. 

How to Learn More
=================

1. ZZLib contains a demo application which you can compile and start in simulator.
   The files within Demo group of ZZLib project are great examples of library usage.
2. Read the docs: http://iutinvg.github.com/ZZLib/
3. Read the sources. They are pretty flat, besides there are some examples of good 
   practices used by great developers all over the world (see Thanks section).  

Thanks

ZZLib uses many third party open source pieces of code, libraries, tools and frameworks:

- [ShareKit](http://getsharekit.com/) by Nathan Weiner, his SHKActivityIndicator is integrated in ZZLib (it is renamed to ZZActivityIndicator for consistance)
- https://github.com/stig/json-framework by Stig Brautaset
- a lot of inspiration came from Three20
- documentation is generated by amazing [appledocs](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc)
- webview's back and forward buttons were created by http://stackoverflow.com/users/239880/ff10 (http://www.effzehn.de/Imagehost/webViewNavigationIcons.zip)

The following libraries are not used here, but you can find them useful:

- buttons: http://code.google.com/p/iphonegradientbuttons/
- network caching: https://github.com/rs/SDURLCache (looks like it'll be included here soon)
- Reachability class by Apple (necessary almost always, great stuff)
