ZZLib
=====

ZZLib is a collection of iPhone classes and macros cought by us on the Internet
and integrated with each other. Our main idea is to keep the library easy to use and make it very simple.

Generated documentation: http://iutinvg.github.com/ZZLib/

Features
--------

- easy tables with remote JSON data
- easy controller creation without NIB files
- you can still use NIB files
- other features coming soon
- very clear logging (`ZZLOG`)
- number of useful macros and functions: `ZZIsPad`, `ZZRGBA`, etc

Installation
============

1. Clone the repository:
	git://github.com/iutinvg/ZZLib.git
2. This will create ZZLib folder, where you can find ZZ.xcodeproj. Open it in Xcode.
3. Drag ZZLib group and drop it in your project. 

How to Learn More
=================

1. ZZLib contains a demo application which you can compile and start in simulator.
   The files within Demo group of ZZLib project are great examples of library usage.
2. Read the docs (soming soon).
3. Read the sources. They are pretty flat, besides there are some examples of good 
   practices used by great developers all over the worlds (see Thanks section).
